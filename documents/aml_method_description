## motif analysis

Motif analysis has been done using MEME v5.1.1 and the HOCOMOCOv11_full_HUMAN_mono database of human motifs. the fasta file was a personalized genome of MV411 using hg38 fasta filen and  mutations called by Haplotype Caller on CCLE's 30x WGS of MV411.
Motifs were called on MV411 using open region of the genome from MV411's ATACseq file. Found motifs were merged into our conscensus set of peaks from the cobinding matrix, if they were at most 100 bp from the peak.
